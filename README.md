# foia_data_mining
A repository for R code that mines XML data downloaded from [foia.gov](https://www.foia.gov/)

## Overview
This code will extract data stored in XML format as provided by the [Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) website](https://www.foia.gov/). You can specify your agency (e.g., Dept. of Labor) and the subcomponents of 
interest (e.g., Occupational Safety and Health Administration). You can also specify your 
relevant FOIA reporting metrics (e.g., Response Time, Backlog, etc.). 

Ultimately, the code will return a list of data frames, where each data frame is the metric
of interest.
